### Bugs
- when editting two cards, pressing "Save" on one card will save all other cards
- when editting two cards, pressing "Save" on one card will save the last editted rating but set the rating for the other card to 1
- when editting card, rating gets reset to 0. if saved without pressing any stars, the rating value will be saved as 1
